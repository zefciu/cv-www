My CV as web application. Sort of demo of what I can do.

Installation and Setup
======================
Install ``cv-www`` using easy_install::
    easy_install cv-www
Make a config file as follows::
    paster make-config cv-www config.ini
Tweak the config file as appropriate and then setup the application::
    paster setup-app config.ini
Then you are ready to go.
